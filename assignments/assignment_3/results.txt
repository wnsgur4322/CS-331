In pre-processing step, we extrated two bag of words files (preprocessed_train.txt & preprocessed_test.txt) from trainingSet.txt and testSet.txt
For classification step, we trained our model with the preprocessed data
With the trained model, we tested with trainingSet.txt to get training accuracy
The training accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier: 0.915832
After training and testing with training set, we trained our model with the preprocessed data of training
With the trained model, we tested with testSet.txt to get test accuracy
The test accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier: 0.756539
